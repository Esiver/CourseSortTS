To match a set of teachers to courses, you will need to take into consideration the following factors:

Availability: working hours.

Qualifications: You need to match teachers who have the relevant qualifications with courses that have the same requirements.

Location: Matching teachers who live closer to the course location can help reduce travel time and expenses.

Please make an algorithm that matches a set of courses with a set of teachers.

Sure, here's an algorithm that matches a set of courses with a set of teachers based on availability, qualifications, and location:

1) For each course, create a list of all available teachers who meet the qualifications for that course.
2) Sort the list of teachers for each course based on their availability during the course schedule.
3) If multiple teachers are equally available, choose the teacher who lives closest to the course location.
4) Assign the top available teacher to the course.
5) If there are more courses than available teachers, repeat steps 1-4 until all courses are assigned a teacher.
6) If there are more available teachers than courses, repeat steps 1-4 until all teachers are assigned a course or until there are no more courses left.

Here's a pseudo-code implementation of the algorithm:


for each course in courses:
    available_teachers = []
    for each teacher in teachers:
        if teacher.qualifications meets course.requirements and teacher.is_available during course.schedule:
            available_teachers.append(teacher)
    available_teachers.sort(key=lambda teacher: teacher.distance_to(course.location))
    course.teacher = available_teachers[0]
    teachers.remove(available_teachers[0])

while teachers and courses:
    for teacher in teachers:
        if not courses:
            break
        course = courses[0]
        if teacher.qualifications meets course.requirements and teacher.is_available during course.schedule:
            course.teacher = teacher
            teachers.remove(teacher)
            courses.remove(course)
Note: The implementation assumes that the distance between the teacher and course location can be calculated using a distance_to method.
